# Welcome to QUIZHOOT!

- users can make their quiz private (not available on the home page, but if someone knows the quiz URL they can visit and take the quiz)
- users can share a link to a single quiz
- users can see a list of public quizzes on the home page
- users can attempt a quiz
- users can see the results of their recent attempt
- users can share a link to the result of their attempt
